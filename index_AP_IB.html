                    <h2>What is AP?</h2>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">AP stands for Advanced Placement. These are challenging tests that the CollegeBoard only offers once a year. Typically a student will take the corresponding AP course for whatever AP test he or she plans to take. </p>
                    <p class = "section-paragraph">What AP courses you can take are limited to what your school offers so check with your guidance counselor or with your school’s course handbook to see what you APs you can take.</p>
                    <p class = "section-paragraph">Beware! AP courses are considered college level courses so they are quite difficult. </p>
                </div>

                <div class = "col-lg-12">
                    <h2>Why Should I Take AP?</h2>
                    <p class = "section-paragraph">
                        It reflects well on you! Colleges love seeing “rigor of curriculum.” What does that mean? Admissions officers want to see you challenge yourself academically which means taking AP or honors level courses. 
                    </p>
                    <p class = "section-paragraph">
                        AP exams can get you college credit! Each school has their own AP credit policy but if you score well enough on the AP exam, you can potentially get college credit and skip out of intro level courses.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class = "col-lg-12">
                    <h2>How Many Should I Take?</h2>
                    <p class = "section-paragraph">
                        Don’t take too many; all APs is not be a good idea if you want to survive the school year with your sanity. Take APs in subjects that interest you. There are enough APs to satisfy every interest.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class = "col-lg-12">
                    <h2>What if my School Doesn't Offer Many AP's?</h2>
                    <p class = "section-paragraph">
                        Don’t worry. College admissions officers take this into account when reviewing your application. If your school only offers 3 APs, you won’t be looked down on for just taking 2. However, you should take as much advantage of your school’s offerings as possible. So if your school offers 20 APs, you should take more over the course of 4 years than 3 AP classes. 
                    </p>
                    <p class = "sectoin-paragraph">
                        Also consider taking the course online. Talk with your guidance counselor to discuss your options about takinig the course through an authorized online provider.
                    </p>
                    <p class = "section-paragraph">
                        Make sure to take as advanced class as possible, whether that be dual-enrollment at a college, or IB, which we will discuss later.

                    <p class = "section-paragraph">

                        Since IB is a curriculum, consider how much time you have to spend outside of class, not only for homework but for the 150 creativity, action, and service hours. During junior and senior year you have to take standardized tests like the SAT, ACT, and subject tests.</p>
                    <p class = "section-paragraph">
                        AP might be more flexible since you can pick and choose what classes to join. However, AP is still a considerable big time commitment.

                        IB require $160 registration fee per year and then $110 per exam. 
                        APs are $91 per exam. So IB is more expensive.
