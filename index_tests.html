           			<li>If it is your first time taking the SAT and you have plenty of time left to retake the test, it is recommended that you keep your first score. This will allow you to see what is your weaknesses and provide you a chance to improve. 
           			</li>
           			<li>
           			Many students cancel their scores because they think they did poorly. Trust yourself and wait for the result. Worst case, you just retake it. It is good to take the SAT multiple times to guarantee that you get the best score.

                <p class="lead3">
                 	When you are submitting your SAT score to colleges, you have several options. You can send in all the scores, send scores from a single day, or send in your superscore (higheset subscores from different test dates).  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Because you have several ways to choose the score, you also have multiple options to cancel the scores.  
                    <br>
                    You can't cancel each subsection, but you can cancel the whole test. SAT is administered several times throughout the year and you can just retake the SAT. 
					<br>
					<p class="lead2">
						The process of cancelling score for SAT is similar to cancelling for SAT Subject tests. Please look below for the process.

                <p class="lead3">
                    If you take multiple tests in one sitting and you wish to cancel one of them, you have to cancel all. With that in mind, think carefully when you are signing up for more than one Subject test. Ask yourself if you are prepared to take more than one tests.

                    <br>
                    Sometimes College Board does allow you to cancel just one score because of calculator malfunction or other reasons.

                    If you keep your score, you can choose the score you want to send in to colleges. However, if you don't use the Score Choice, all scores will be sent to colleges automatically.
                    Make sure you report your score in time if you don't want colleges to look at some of your scores.

                Everyone has different preferences for standardized tests. 
                <br>
                <br> For instance, the ACT is recommended for students able to work well under time-constraints. On the other hand, the SAT is best for students with advanced critical thinking skills.
                <br>
                <br>
                While both tests require time-management skills, you need to pace yourself more for ACT. Both tests have their pros and cons.
